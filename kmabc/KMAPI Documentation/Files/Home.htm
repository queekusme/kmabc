<P>
Thankyou for wanting to try the KMAPI api for KMABC.<P>

The following pages on the left show all of the functions that can be called using kmabc and contain some examples on how to use them.
<P>
There is a demonstration modification that you can use to see how to get started. this is enclosed in the: "DEMOMOD.zip".<BR>
Extract this into the folder it is in and run the "KmabcModInstaller.exe" executable.
<P>
<P>
Unlike version 1.3, all future versions of kmapi will support the following format:
<PRE>
[mod_*.zip]
	| -- [mod_***.lua]
	| -- [modInstall.istl]
	| -- [mods required image files]
</PRE>
Once extracted, run the "KmabcModInstaller.exe" executable. to install the modification.

When starting a mod, the first file you need to crerate is the mod_*.lua<BR>
where the * is the name of your mod.

enter the following lines into the mod:
<P>
<FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="black">import "QueekusPlugins.kmabc.kmapi";</FONT> -- This is important else you wont have access to the api features
<P>
<FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="black">identifyer = "xxx";</FONT> -- This is required for adding buttons and other features. it is a good practice to name the * in the mod_*.lua this too.
<P>
<FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="black">ModID = kmapi.getNextFreeId()</FONT> -- This allows you to have a unique id for your mod that none of the others will have.
<P>
After adding this, add these lines:<BR>
<FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="black"><B><PRE>* = 	{ -- Where * is the name of your mod
		loadmod = function()
		end
	}</PRE></B></FONT>
<P>
This is where all of your calls go. See the "DEMOMOD.zip" file's mod_*.lua file to see how to use them
<P>
The second file you will need is the "modInstall.istl" file.
<P>
In here, put the following:<P>
<FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="black">xxx</FONT> -- where xxx is the full name of your mod. This appears in the installer and not in the plugin.<BR> 
<FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="black">*</FONT> -- Where * is the name of your mod<BR>
<FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="black">
import "QueekusPlugins.kmabc.*";</FONT> -- Where * is the name of your mod
<P>
FOR REFERENCE, HERE ARE THE 2 FILES YOU HAVE CREATED IN FULL:
<P>
<B>mod_xxx.lua</B>
<TABLE Border = 1>
<TR>
	<TD><PRE>import "QueekusPlugins.kmabc.kmapi";
identifyer = "xxx";
ModID = kmapi.getNextFreeId()

xxx = 	{
		loadmod = function()
		end
	}
</PRE></TD>
</TR>
</table>
<P>
<B>modInstall.istl</B>
<TABLE Border = 1>
<TR>
	<TD><PRE>xxx The Mod For KMABC
xxx
import "QueekusPlugins.kmabc.mod_xxx";</PRE></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
The rest is upto you, add colours, languages, buttons and have fun.
